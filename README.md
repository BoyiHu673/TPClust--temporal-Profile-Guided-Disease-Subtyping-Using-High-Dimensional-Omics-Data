# TPClust--temporal-Profile-Guided-Disease-Subtyping-Using-High-Dimensional-Omics-Data
## This markdown file contains R code for the manuscript entitled "TPClust: Temporal Profile-Guided Subtyping Using High-Dimensional Omics Data"
## Our implementation uses the MOSEK solver for optimization problems with LASSO and group LASSO penalties. Therefore, MOSEK and its R interface must be installed prior to using this package, therefore the installation of MOSEK solver in R is required.

1. Download the correct version of MOSEK based on your machine from the official website (https://www.mosek.com/downloads/)

2. Set up a license following the instructions (https://docs.mosek.com/11.0/licensing/index.html). For academic faculty, students or staff, Academic Licenses for MOSEK can be request from https://www.mosek.com/products/academic-licenses/

3. Follow installation instructions (https://docs.mosek.com/11.0/rmosek/install-interface.html) to install MOSEK in R.
